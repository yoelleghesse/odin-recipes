        <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
