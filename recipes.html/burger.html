    <h2><p><em>The following is the recipe for making a delicious burger</em></p></h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop pan to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties about 3/4 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the patties with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill or pan. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare, or longer if you prefer your burgers more well-done.</li>
        <li>If you're adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, you can toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster if desired.</li>
        <li>Once the patties are cooked to your liking, remove them from the grill or pan and let them rest for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble your burgers by placing the patties on the bottom halves of the buns. Add your favorite toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Place the top halves of the buns on the burgers and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
